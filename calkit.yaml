        The STRAVA_CLIENT_ID and STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET environmental
        variables can be set in the .env file after creating a Strava

questions:
  - Can we estimate a temperature-normalized power versus heart rate curve
    to track changes in performance?
  - What do my weekly power and heart rate distributions look like?
  - How can I increase my total energy expenditure?
  - What weekly power distribution should I strive for in order to maximize
    performance?
  - What weekly power distribution should I strive for in order to maximize
    energy expenditure, assuming maximum energy expenditure correlates with
    higher performance?

      The top figure above shows power and heart rate distributions from
      the latest week of data. The figure below that shows these weekly
      distributions over the past 24 weeks, along with the total weekly
      energy expenditure.
calculations:
  latest_timestamp:
    cache: true # Run as part of `calkit run` since input is not variable
    # TODO: Should this just be part of the pipeline?
    # We could store a metric instead of having this as a calculation, since
    # calculations are meant to be interactive
    # We can put them in the pipeline by reading this file first
